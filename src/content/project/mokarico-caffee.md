Next.js is a robust React framework that gives considerable weight to rendering strategies to boost the performance and user experience of web applications. Comprehending the intricacies of rendering in Next.js is vital for developers seeking to develop fast, interactive, and SEO-optimized websites.

In this piece, we examine the various rendering techniques provided by Next.js and how they can be utilized to attain specific objectives. We cover Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Static Site Generation (SSG), Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR), and Client-Side Rendering (CSR), each playing a unique role in shaping the behavior and efficiency of Next.js applications.
